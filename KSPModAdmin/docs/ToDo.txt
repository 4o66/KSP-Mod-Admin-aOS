//// BUGS
/////////////////////
- ModName changes after Mod update.
- AVC Plugin - Problem when a mod archive contains multiple version files. (Sample: Mission Controller 2 on KerbalStuff)
- Some mods have additional folders that normally doesn't install. 
  It can be folders with alternative data, manuals, etc. For examples see Planet Shine or UniversalStorage [TAC PACK]. 
  Usually Mod Admin can't detect installation path for them and shows warning. When I update this mods, Mod Admin shows warning again for every root node 
  without installation path. I update in "Copy checked state" mode.

- I dunno if it's a KSMPA-problem or KSP, but trying to do Borderless Window (fullscreen resolution) with OpenGL forced throws a KSP-error :/
- When using the "Get ModInfos" button with a "KSP Forum" version control, the ProductID get wrong data (I got this issue with KMA 1.4 too)


//// TODO
/////////////////////

- Disable 64-Bit vor windows.

- Set default button on remove mods to "No" ...

- LINUX - Steam installs KSP to a hidden folder...
  Workaround: Create a link to the install directory and use that instead

- Progressbar for frmAddMod during download. 

- MONO:
  - TreeListView improvement -> Column Header draw and row offset ...

- ModInfos are automatically added about add-ons where a valid version control site is detected. 
  That is great, however some information fields are not automatically filled (Author, Creation date, Change date). 
  I currently have add-ons checking with many different Version Control sites (GitHub, CurseForge, KerbalStuff, KSP Forum) 
  but with none those fields are filled.

- Overwrite button states are indistinguishable. It's hard to say, what mode it is in. May be CheckBox would be more visual?
  - Change ToolTip to display On/Off state?

- AVC Plugin version file support
  - Bug fix see BUGS above.
  
- ReadMe

- is everything Async ???

- KSPForum support.

- Control rearrangement for localization

- ModSelection
  -> key action binding -> del = remove mod ...

- Restart destination detection.

- Revise of the English/German text
  - unify URL, link, site, page
  - spelling error
  - wording

- Don't load all languages into memory! 

- Tab to enable/disable plugins
  - Don't enable unknown plugins during loading.
  - Save known plugins (+ enable state) to AppConfig.
  - Remove known but not found plugins (or ask the user).

- Try loading old KSPModAdmin.cfg file if no new cfg file is available.
  -> For AppConfig and KSPConfig!
  
- Search in ModSelection.

- Center CheckBoxes in TreeViewAdv.

- Implementation of a waffle iron !!! =)


//// SUGGESTIONS
/////////////////////

- Option to add files to an exclude list for mod install (like readme, txt, licenses ...)
- Compress for zipping.
- Add/Show Cancel button during Archive extraction 
  (think about what happens to the already extract or deleted files --> transaction?!)
